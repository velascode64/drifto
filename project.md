## Core Features Checklist

- [ ] Mobile app first
- [ ] Opti## 🚧 Technical Challenges and Solutions

Not a blocker — but needs to be strategically navigated:

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ❗ iOS Full Access restriction | Only prompt when user activates Pro features (e.g. AI proposed times) |
| ❗ App Store rejection risk | Be very clear in onboarding and App Store metadata about use case |
| ❗ User trust | Educate users with a clear visual of "we never log keystrokes or read messages" |ross all apps once the app is installed and added to keyboard
- [ ] Recognizes phrases like “ how about 3pm Thursday?” - uses ai to detect your time zone and theirs 
- [ ] Allows you to schedule the meeting after it
- [ ] Allows you to set on the app where your contacts are located. They get to update on their end also
- [ ] Allows users to input upcoming locations in advance 
- [ ] Settings - allow calendar sync paid
- [ ] Settings - allow keyboard to show pop up to lock in the time and push to calendar - paid 
- [ ] When it’s——- 8am in ———— what time is it in—————



That’s Why Drifto Can Win
* Timing is right
* Tech is ready
* Competitors are still calendar-based
* User behavior is already there



Together, it becomes more than a tool — it becomes a time-aware messaging intelligence layer, which grows more useful the more people use it


Allow users to set known time zones for specific contacts.
* E.g., “Sarah lives in LA” → when you type “Let’s talk tomorrow at 2PM”, it shows:"2PM your time (That’s 6AM for Sarah)"
Make this smart + AI-powered over time (auto-detect location from context)


Behavioral Learning
* Over time, AI learns:
    * When you usually like to meet (e.g. never mornings)
    * Which contacts are in which zones
    * How far in advance you like to plan
* It pre-fills your preferences or automates replies like:“How about Thursday at 8AM your time / 4PM mine?

"Global conversation optimizer" for scheduling and time clarity.
Here’s where this could evolve:
* 🔄 Multi-timezone group support → For chats with 3+ people in different zones, AI finds overlap time blocks
* 📆 Smart calendar integration → Connect to Google/Outlook to recommend real open slots
* 🗣️ Voice command: “Propose a meeting with Alex this Friday” → AI drafts it with time-zone-aware logic
* 🌐 Language-agnostic: Works across languages (“vendredi prochain à 14h”) using multilingual NLP


## AI Models and Tools

| Use Case | AI Tool / Model |
|----------|----------------|
| NLP for fuzzy time parsing | spaCy, Duckling, OpenAI, or a fine-tuned transformer |
| Conversational logic / tone | GPT-4 (ChatGPT API) or Cohere |
| Time zone prediction | Custom ML + device/IP geo tagging |
| Behavior learning | On-device ML (Core ML / TensorFlow Lite) or Firebase ML |
| Multilingual support | DeepL API or open-source multilingual BERT |



## Monetization Strategy

### 🧩 Freemium Model (most effective path)

#### Free Tier (core utility):

* Time zone conversion for incoming/outgoing messages

* Basic keyboard overlay (in 1–2 apps at a time)

* Manual contact time zone setting

* AI guesses sender’s time zone

Premium Tier ($3.99–$5.99/month or $29/year):


* Auto time detection across all apps

* Smart suggestions: “Best times for both of you”

* Auto-sync with Google/Apple calendars

* Priority response: one-tap replies like "Yes, that works for me at 9PM"

* Multi-timezone group chat handling

* Custom availability windows per day/contact

* Travel mode: app auto-updates your zone and sends proactive suggestions

* Ability to restrict certain people from seeing your location and upcoming location

* Home Screen. - suggest a time to meet ‘ John Smith’ ( input name ) 

* Block people from seeing your location in the app








- [ ] Options after agreeing  - in person meeting/ call/ video call.
- [ ] Second option - work/ personal


## Value Propositions

* Instant time zone conversion within any chat
* One-tap accept/reject/reschedule without leaving the convo
* Auto-suggested meeting times based on mutual availability
* Integrates with existing tools (Calendar, WhatsApp, Slack)


Freemium model with viral loop
* Free version with core features
* Paid Pro version: calendar sync, AI scheduling, priority time slots


Viral loop: users propose time → recipient sees Drifto → prompted to install



“Smart scheduling, woven into your chat.

“Turn timezone chaos into clarity.

“Global conversations, local clarity.”

“You talk. We translate the time.”

“No more math. Just meet.


None provide a system-wide keyboard plugin that intercepts typed input inside apps and offers real-time localized conversions like Drifto plans to do.


- [ ] Summary: The Gap & Your Potential
Your concept — an AI-powered keyboard that detects proposed meeting times in chat and displays the equivalent in the user’s time zone — is completely novel in the scheduling and productivity space.

Unlike Calendly or WordPress plugins that rely on standalone scheduling interfaces, Drifto aims to be seamlessly embedded in everyday messaging. That creates a major advantage in ease and immediacy


- [ ] ✅ Workaround for Drifto: You stay within ethical limits — just parsing what the user types (e.g. “Let’s chat Friday at 3PM”) and offering timezone overlays in real-time, which is allowed.


- [ ] lightweight, AI-powered control center for timezone-aware communication, not a full calendar or scheduling app.
You're positioning Drifto as the “timezone brain” that plugs into your existing chat and calendar apps — and the home screen should reflect that.



🧠 AI Usage Tiers (eventually)

Offer tiered access to:

* Daily AI-suggested time proposals (5/day for free, unlimited for paid)

* GPT-enhanced tone suggestions ("Polite", "Casual", "Formal")

* Conversation memory (recalls past proposed times, suggests follow-up)



✅ Can Drifto be Built as a Keyboard Plugin?


💡 Short Answer:


Yes — both iOS and Android support custom keyboards, and many apps (e.g. Grammarly, Gboard, Bitmoji, SwiftKey) have done this successfully at scale. But you must comply with specific rules, especially around privacy, permissions, and App Store guidelines.

🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS BY PLATFORM
🔵 iOS (Apple)


* Supported since iOS 8

* You build a custom keyboard extension via Xcode

* Required to submit through App Store Connect as part of your main app


⚠️ Key Limitations:

* No network access by default — unless user enables “Allow Full Access”🔹 This is critical if your keyboard needs to use AI or call APIs

* App Store must approve the use of Full Access, which has been rejected in the past if it seems invasive or vague in purpose
* No access to context of the app where it's used (e.g. can't detect it’s WhatsApp vs iMessage natively without workarounds)


🟢 Android

* Much more open and flexible

* You can build fully-featured custom keyboards with:

    * Real-time text prediction
    * Contextual AI
    * Background syncing

* Can detect more about the app context and allow deeper integration (e.g., knowing you're inside WhatsApp)


🛡️ LEGAL / PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS


iOS and Android both require strict handling of user data:


* You cannot collect keystrokes without user consent and a very clear privacy policy

* You must explain exactly what data is being accessed and why

* For App Store approval, Apple is stricter, especially if Full Access is needed

🔒 Mitigation Strategy:

* Build with on-device AI for freemium tier (no Full Access needed)

* Gate cloud-based features (like calendar syncing or AI matching) behind Full Access — with a clear onboarding process

* Follow the App Tracking Transparency and privacy policies to the letter

* Be transparent in your Terms & Privacy Policy — include these in app submission




🚧 Is This a Problem for Drifto?
Not a blocker — but needs to be strategically navigated:


Concern	Solution
❗ iOS Full Access restriction	Only prompt when user activates Pro features (e.g. AI proposed times)
❗ App Store rejection risk	Be very clear in onboarding and App Store metadata about use case
❗ User trust	Educate users with a clear visual of “we never log keystrokes or read messages”

✅ Recommendation for Drifto

1. Launch v1 with limited functionality using on-device processing (basic time detection and prompts)

1. Unlock cloud features (AI, scheduling suggestions) only after Full Access is enabled

1. Add fallback iOS widgets or share sheet integrations for users who don’t enable Full Access

1. Invest in user education & trust: Make your privacy-first approach a core part of your brand messaging






Stream	Example
B2B licensing	Offer team accounts to remote-first startups or distributed companies (like Slack, Notion, GitLab) who want time-intelligent messaging across teams
Affiliate links	Add “Propose time” → links to Calendly/Google/Zoom → monetize via referral
Enterprise API	License your time parsing + location detection AI to other messaging or scheduling platforms
In-app purchases	Sell premium stickers or time-zone visuals (more aesthetic add-ons)

⚙️ Growth Flywheel

* Every time someone uses the app in a message, they send a branded signature or invite (“This time works: 3PM your time / 9PM mine — powered by ChronoSync AI”).
* This drives organic exposure and virality, especially in professional and cross-time-zone use cases.




Value prop


Time is the Ultimate Currency
💬 “Every 1 minute wasted coordinating time zones adds up to billions in lost productivity globally.”

* A McKinsey study estimates that 28% of the average knowledge worker's week is spent on communication (email, coordination).

* In global teams, up to 20% of scheduling attempts involve time zone or calendar confusion.

* If 500M professionals spend even 2–3 minutes per day on misaligned scheduling, that’s:

    * ≈ 1.2 billion minutes/day wasted
    * ≈ $80B–$100B yearly productivity drag globally
* 
✅ Drifto turns that 3-minute mental math into a 1-tap answer.




Global Teams = Global Confusion

* 76% of teams today are distributed or hybrid, requiring frequent time zone conversions.

* Google Calendar and Calendly are calendar-centric — Drifto is conversation-centric, intercepting proposed meeting times in real time where conversations happen.

Drifto isn’t a better calendar. It’s a smarter keyboard



Cost of Friction in Fast-Moving Teams


A single 15-minute delay in a high-performing startup team of 10 = ~$500 in lost velocity.

* Multiply that across hundreds of async messages per week across Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.

* Enterprise teams lose up to $100M/year in meeting inefficiencies (source: Harvard Business Review).

Drifto cuts this friction at the source.




User-Level Hooks (Viral Loop Levers)


* 82% of users who install productivity tools say they’ve missed or misaligned a meeting in the past month due to timezone mishandling.

* 91% of users say they check availability across at least 2 platforms (e.g., email + WhatsApp or Slack).

* Drifto plugs in where this chaos happens — across chats, not just calendars



💡 Positioning for Investors

“We’re going after the productivity friction before it ever hits the calendar. That’s a new wedge. And it’s viral.”

* Bottom-up GTM → high-margin SaaS at scale

* Low CAC via keyboard plugin virality

* Strong monetization through premium utilities and enterprise upsell

* Retention booster: If Drifto is in your keyboard, it’s daily-use. That’s sticky.




🧠 Strategic Recommendation: Start Bottom-Up, Then Layer Enterprise


Step-by-Step GTM Flow:

1. Phase 1: Build traction with high-context users

    * Target: remote freelancers, async team members, solopreneurs, remote-first companies
    * Hook: “Never mess up a meeting time again.”
    * Incentivize virality: “Unlock Drifto Pro free when 3 of your contacts install Drifto”

1. Phase 2: Layer Premium

    * Unlock AI calendar sync + availability detection
    * Target heavy users with nudges: “Upgrade to make scheduling 3x faster”

## 🔍 Core Meeting Proposal Phrases

### 1. ✅ Direct Time Proposals


These phrases explicitly suggest a meeting time:

* “Are you free at [time]?”
* “Want to hop on a call at [time]?”
* “Let’s meet at [time]”
* “Can you do [day] at [time]?”
* “Available [day] at [time]?”
* “I’m thinking [time] your time?”
* “Let’s catch up around [time]”
* “Would [time] work for you?”
* “What time suits you on [day]?”
* “How about [time] tomorrow?”


2. 🔁 Rescheduling / Time Change Prompts


These trigger re-evaluation of time zones or availability:
* “Can we move our meeting to [time]?”
* “Is it okay to push it to [time]?”
* “Let’s reschedule for [day/time]”
* “Something came up, how’s [time] instead?”
* “Let’s shift our call to [time]”
* “Can we do a bit later/earlier?”

3. 🗓️ Calendar Invite Prompts


Common phrases when someone intends to formalize a meeting:
* “I’ll send a calendar invite for [time]”
* “Can you drop it in my calendar?”
* “I’ll add it to my Google/Outlook”
* “Add it to your calendar”
* “Shoot me a calendar link”

4. 🤝 Informal Catch-Up or Meeting Suggestions


More casual, but still scheduling-relevant:
* “Quick catch-up later?”
* “Grab a coffee at [time]?”
* “Jump on a Zoom?”
* “Catch you around [time]?”
* “Free for a quick chat?”
* “Fancy a call on [day]?”

5. 📍 Location + Time-Based Phrases


Useful when combined with NLP to extract time/place intent:
* “Let’s do [location] at [time]”
* “Meet me at [place] around [time]”
* “Dinner/lunch at [time]?”
* “Let’s do brunch on [day]”

🧠 Suggested NLP Strategy for Drifto

Component	Description
NER (Named Entity Recognition)	To identify dates, times, and locations (e.g., “Friday”, “10am”, “New York”)
Intent Detection	Classify messages as “meeting proposal” vs casual text
Time & Zone Normalization	Convert phrases like “next Friday at 2” to ISO timestamps and compare between users
Confidence Scoring	Trigger Drifto only when probability of proposal > e.g., 85%

🛠️ Bonus: Edge Cases to Plan For

* “Let’s touch base next week” → vague
* “Are you around?” → needs context
* “I’m free after lunch” → needs time mapping
* “Any chance you’re free later?” → subjective “later”
* Emojis (“📞 2pm?”) or short replies (“Yeah, 1pm?”) → require contextual thread parsing
